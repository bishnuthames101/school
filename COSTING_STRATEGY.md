## 15. Sales Scripts & Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

#### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"
**Response:**
"I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at the alternatives:
- Custom development: $50,000-$150,000
- Doing nothing: Losing students to competitors with better websites
- Our solution: $3,500-$12,000 one-time

Plus, our ROI calculator shows you'll save $15,000+ in the first year alone through time savings and reduced printing costs. Many schools see the investment pay for itself in under 2 months through increased enrollments."

**Offer:**
"Would the Starter package at $3,500 fit better? We can always upgrade later."

---

#### Objection 2: "We already have a website"
**Response:**
"That's great! Let me ask:
- Does it have an admin panel where you can update events and notices yourself?
- Can parents submit applications online?
- Is it mobile-friendly?
- Can you track and manage applications?

If any answer is 'no', you're losing opportunities daily. We can migrate your existing content for free and have you up and running in 72 hours with all these features."

---

#### Objection 3: "We need to think about it"
**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help your decision-making, I can:
1. Provide a free demo customized with your school's branding
2. Share case studies from similar schools
3. Connect you with one of our existing school clients

What specific information would help you make a confident decision?"

**Offer:**
"If you're ready within 7 days, we're offering 15% off plus a free SMS notification module worth $1,500."

---

#### Objection 4: "Can we build this ourselves?"
**Response:**
"Technically, yes - if you have a development team and 6-12 months. Let me break down what that actually costs:

Development: 200+ hours × $50/hour = $10,000+
Hosting setup: $1,000
Security: $2,000
Testing: $1,500
Maintenance: $2,000/year
Total: $15,000+

Plus, your team will be maintaining code instead of education. We've already invested thousands of hours building and testing this. You're essentially renting our development for pennies on the dollar."

---

#### Objection 5: "We'll use Wix/Squarespace"
**Response:**
"Those are good for simple websites, but schools need more:
- Can Wix manage 500 admission applications in a database? No.
- Can parents filter notices by category? No.
- Can you give 10 staff members different admin access? No.
- Can you track application status from submitted to accepted? No.

Wix is fine for restaurants or blogs. Schools need school management systems. That's what we built."

**Comparison:**
"Plus, Wix costs $500-$2,000/year forever. Our Starter is $3,500 once, then just $800/year maintenance. Over 5 years, we're actually cheaper and far more capable."
